# erpcore_scripts
This repository contains scripts for preprocessing and analysis of the ERPCORE MMN dataset

Data inside the "ERPCORE_MMN_SET_FILES" folder was copied from ERP CORE by Emily S. Kappenman and  Steven J. Luck (https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R).

The file "analysis.py" preprocesses and analyzes data in the "ERPCORE_MMN_SET_FILES" folder

The file "bayes_factors.r" calculates pairwise t-test Bayes factors between mean amplitudes measured over 125-225 ms from consecutive 80 dB standards (sS), 70 dB deviants after 80 dB standards (sD), and 80 dB standards after 70 dB deviants (dS).
